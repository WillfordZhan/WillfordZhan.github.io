# BTH 003 Studying note (1)

## A. Interaction
1. How do you do a thing?
2. After doing this, how do you feel?
3. Finally, what information did you get?

#### Two activity models

## B. Research
#### 1. Type
* Evaluation or Change-oriented
* Real world or basic research
* Academia or Industry
  - Industry: Developing a solution to a problem
  - Academia: Why should we do this?

#### 2. attitude
* Systematical, skeptical, ethical
* Conclusion: empirical evidences-based (Experiment)
* Objective

#### 3. Methodology
* Fixed design: user's need-oriented
* Flexible design: detect the need of users
* Mixed

#### 4. A model process
* Directions: inductive / deductive ?
  - inductive research: fact/data up to concept/conclusion
  - deductive research: concept to physical world (Verification-alike)
* Design -> Sampling -> data collection -> data analysis -> report

#### 5. Design
* Originality
  - New product
  - New technique
* Project Diary (fake-banned)
* Right Subject
  - Knowledge about the subject
  - Interest
  - The fashion
  - Challenge vs capability
  - Empirical evidence available(data-retrievable/case available)
* Risks to be unscientific
  - Too general / too specific
  - Too much raw work(research irrelavant)
  - Descriptive / case-lacked or data-lacked
  - Only reference without critical thinking
